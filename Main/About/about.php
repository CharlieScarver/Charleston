				Sasho, Charlie, Itachi, Okabe, <br>
				no matter what name you know him by, <br>you know there's no other mad scientist quite like him. <br>
				He's a hungry for knowledge programmer <br>with dreams nearly as big as my butt. <br>
				If you want to find him, you can always <br>jump down the rabbit hole and you will find yourself <br>
				soaring in the sky where you will feel freedom. <br>And where there is freedom, there is Sasho. <br>
				He has a vast imagination and isn't afraid <br>to use it, be it for the creation of physical embodiments of his ideas <br>
				or to find more things to do when <br>he's already late for an occasion. <br>
				He's an exceptional person (who I'm lucky to be able to call mine) <br>
				and you should give him gummy bears <br>or oreos when you see him <br>
				(so that I can steal and devour them later). <br>

				<b>A Glimpse Of Her</b> <br>
				<br>
				Enchanting. Beautiful. Insane. <br>Funny. Sweet. Tender. Brilliant. <br>All of this and more. 
				She's full of life. <br>An artist, a dancer, a nymph, a psychologist, an experimenter. <br>And she cooks. 
				She shines, while smiling. <br>Her ember eyes are full of honesty, love and sparks. <br>
				If I fall, she'll always catch me. Then she'll be proud of it. <br>And then she'll trip on something and someone'll get hurt. <br>
				She provokes me, makes me think more, do more, care more. <br>I can never show my appreciation of what she's doing for me. <br>
				Infinity is her domain and The Eight is her medium. <br>She has the bravery to pray and the will to want. <br>
				She likes smoke, candles, lanterns and christmas lights. <br>She loves chocolate. <br>
				I gave her many names, yet not enough to describe her. <br>
				Never enough. <br>
